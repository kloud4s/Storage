Pre-checks:
======================
	1. Protocols:
	NFS - Stateless protocol
	CIFS/SMB - State Full protocol
	iSCSI/FC - Multipath, HA enabled or not
	
	2. Note: If the cluster is up for more than 90 days, perform a failover before the upgrade.
	
	::> Storage failover
	
	Reboot SP/BMC
	
	3. No disks or other Hardware failures.
	4. CPU Utilization is less than 60% on each node.
	5. Check vulnerabilities in the current version
	Note: Download the Upgrade advisory from the support portal and check the bug fixes in the latest version
	6. Pause/Quiesced the snapmirror relationships.
	Note: Before the 9.5 version we will perform the upgrade first destination later source cluster
	From 9.6 or above, We can upgrade any cluster at any time. (Best Practice is both source and target cluster running the same version so we don't get any issues, otherwise get few compatibility issues)
	
	
	Compatible ONTAP versions for Snapmirror relationship ----------- To check the compatibility versions.
	
	Note 1: The backward version is also eligible for respective versions.
	
	
	Note 2: Before 9.5 we update the ISO file through HTTP/FTP server on your network, or to your local client, and then add it to the list of available software images.
	
	After 9.5 we have a direct option from GUI.
	
	In System Manager, click Cluster > Overview. and select ONTAP Update. Click Firmware Update. Provide the server URL or the file location
	
	
	7. Steps to upload Image after 9.7 Version
	Cluster --> Update --> Upload ISO file from local client/machine --> Click on Upload
	Note: While upgrading the firmware if the node is rebooted more than 3 times it's an issue, so we raise a case with the support team  
	
	Note 2: NetApp won't upgrade the ONTAP but we raised a case with the support team if get any issues while performing the upgrade we can reach them easily. 
	
	8. Click on Next after uploading the image
	9. Validate
	10. Update
