File Shares - NFS
ONTAP can export storage for project or home directory space, which can be accessed by Windows or UNIX clients. 
Add volumes as the main storage container, which you can further subdivide into quota tree directories with their own quotas. 

SAN
Clients connected to SAN networks — using FC or iSCSI — access LUNs. Add LUNs with the size and performance characteristics required by your application. 
Initiator groups list the initiator WWPNs that can access each LUN. 

Volume Types

	1. Flex Volume: 
		Support both Thin and Thick volumes.
		ONTAP7: We are unable to decrease the volume.
		ONTAP8: We can increase and decrease the volume.
	2. Flex Group
	3. Flex Clone


Create a Volume:

	1. Select SVM
	2. Volume Name
	3. Choose the aggregate
	4. Create volume
	
By default, all volumes are mountain by junction path, if not there we will manually mount.
	
Junction Path: Both NAS and SAN, all NAS volumes mountain in junction path
		>> Mount volume
		Volume name --> Junction name --> Junction path
		 
		
CIFS Shares:
	
	1. Create Share
	2. Folder to share or Browse the volume
	3. Enter the share name 
	4. After creating the share click on Edit and view the permissions or change the permissions and add user if required.
	5. Share path name: //svm1/share1
	6. Map to Windows network drive
	
	
NFS: Linux/Unix
We have a default export policy under NFS

Export policies:
Click on Add under Export policies 
Create Export Rule:
	Client IP Address
	Enable Protocols
	Access details

Mount File System in Linux:
	
>> Login Linux machine using Putty
>> df -h
>> mkdir /share1
>> mount -t nfs svm1:/share1  /share1
>> cd /share1
>> df -h
>> ls


If permission is denied please follow the steps.

Check the security styles under the junction path, if the security style is "NTFS" we are unable to access the file system in Linux.

Name Mapping:

Under SVM settings --> user mapping from Windows to Unix and Unix to Windows

Commands:


  Volume Management

9. Show volume status and details:

vol show
vol show -instance

10. Create a new volume:

vol create -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -aggregate <aggregate_name> -size <size>

11. Resize a volume:

vol size <volume_name> <new_size>

12. Delete a volume:

vol delete -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name>

13. Bring a volume online or offline:

vol online <volume_name>
vol offline <volume_name>
