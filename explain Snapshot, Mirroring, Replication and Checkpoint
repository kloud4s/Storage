Let me explain Snapshot, Mirroring, Replication and Checkpoint ;

☺️All four concepts - snapshots, mirroring, replication, and checkpoints - deal with data protection and management in storage systems. 

👉🏻Here's a breakdown of each:

🤟🏻Snapshot:

✏️Think of it like a photograph capturing a specific moment. A storage snapshot freezes the state of your data at a particular point in time.
✏️Useful for recovering from accidental deletions, malware attacks, or reverting to a known good state.
✏️Snapshots are quick to create and use minimal storage as they only store changes since the last snapshot.

🤟🏻Mirroring:

✏️Imagine having a mirror image of your data. Mirroring creates an exact duplicate of your data on another storage device.
✏️This redundancy ensures high availability. If your primary storage fails, the mirrored copy allows immediate access to your data.
✏️Offers faster recovery times compared to snapshots, but requires double the storage capacity.

🤟🏻Replication:

✏️Similar to mirroring, but data is copied to a separate storage location, which can be on-site or even off-site (like the cloud).
✏️Offers disaster recovery benefits. If a localized event (fire, flood) affects your primary storage, the replicated data at the remote location remains safe.
✏️Replication can be continuous (constant updates) or scheduled (periodic backups). Continuous replication offers the most up-to-date copy but consumes more bandwidth.

🤟🏻Checkpoint:

✏️A checkpoint is a specific point within a process or database transaction where its state is recorded.
✏️It's like a milestone marker for ongoing operations.
✏️Checkpoints are used for rollback functionality. If an error occurs during a process, the system can revert to the last checkpoint and try again.
✏️Checkpoints are often used in conjunction with snapshots to provide more granular recovery options.


👉🏻Snapshots for quick rollbacks.
👉🏻Mirroring for high availability.
👉🏻Replication for disaster recovery.
👉🏻Checkpoints for specific rollback points within processes or transactions.(for NAS)
